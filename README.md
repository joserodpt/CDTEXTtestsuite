# 📀 What is CD-Text?

CD-Text is an extension of the audio CD (Red Book) standard that allows additional information to be stored on a disc, such as:

	•	Track titles
	•	Album title
	•	Artist names

Unlike regular audio CDs, which only include track numbers and durations, CD-Text provides a richer experience by enabling compatible CD players to display this metadata.
